# FastAPI Backend

This is a FastAPI backend application for handling user authentication and database interactions. It uses MongoDB as the database and JWT for authentication.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo-name`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the MongoDB server: `mongod` (on Linux/Mac) or `mongod.exe` (on Windows)
7. Start the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. The following variables are required:

* `MONGODB_URI`: The URI of the MongoDB instance.
* `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for generating JWT tokens.

You can set these variables in your environment or in a `.env` file.

## API Endpoints

The application has the following API endpoints:

* `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
* `POST /login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT token.
* `GET /users`: Returns a list of all users.

## Best Practices

### Security

* Use secure passwords and keep them confidential.
* Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server.
* Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
* Use secure protocols for authentication and authorization.

### Code Quality

* Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
* Use meaningful variable names and comments to make the code readable.
* Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
* Use type hints and docstrings to document the code.

### Testing

* Write unit tests for individual functions and modules.
* Write integration tests for API endpoints and workflows.
* Use a testing framework such as Pytest or Unittest.
* Test for both happy paths and error scenarios.

### Deployment

* Use a containerization tool such as Docker for deployment.
* Use a cloud platform such as AWS or GCP for hosting.
* Use a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
* Monitor the application for performance and security issues.

### Documentation

* Write clear and concise documentation for the API endpoints.
* Use tools such as Swagger or OpenAPI for generating documentation.
* Document the installation, configuration, and deployment process.
* Keep the documentation up-to-date with changes to the code.

### Collaboration

* Use version control systems such as Git for collaboration.
* Use branching and merging for managing changes.
* Use pull requests for code reviews.
* Use issues and project management tools for tracking tasks and bugs.
